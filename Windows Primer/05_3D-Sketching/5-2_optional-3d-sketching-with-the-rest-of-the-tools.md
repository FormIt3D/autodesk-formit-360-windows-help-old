### Optional – 3D Sketching with the rest of the tools

The following exercise is not critical to finishing the house. It will
allow you to experiment with some of the other 3D Sketching tools.

Click to open the Sketching Toolbar

Select the Arc tool

Click to define the first and second point similar to the Line tool

The third drag defines the radius of the circle that defines the arc

Note: as with all sketching tools, you can use the red snap points to
snap to other objects in the scene

Select the Spline tool

Click to define any number of points to draw a spline

Select the Circle tool

Hover and Click to define the center point of the circle

Click and drag to define the radius of the circle

**Important Note:** *When you snap any curve segment to any other point,
line or object face/edge/point, the objects will now be joined as one
object. To avoid this, we will use Groups in a later exercise.*
