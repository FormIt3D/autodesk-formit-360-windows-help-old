Collaboration
-------------

And now for “one last thing!” Real time collaboration. FormIt allows
multiple users (on any combination of iOS or Web clients) to
collaboratively edit a FormIt model – while seeing all of their changes
in real time!

You can now email a link to a colleague. When they open the link, they
will be asked to log into A360 and then you can start collaborating
immediately.
