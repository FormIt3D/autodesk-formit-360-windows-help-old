There are **three ways to copy** an object. First **select** the **object** :

**Right click** the **cube** and **select the Copy tool** - then **rightclick anywhere else** in the scene and **choose** the **paste**
**button** (this also works with **CTRL + C or V**).

**Hold** the **CTRL key down** and **start dragging the object** - a copy will be available to drag.

Right click the **cube** and select the **Array tool**. You can **select** the **number of copies** and whether the next drag will define the **distance between two objects** or the **total length** of the array.
