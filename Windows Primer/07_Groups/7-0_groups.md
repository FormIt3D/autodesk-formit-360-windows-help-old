Groups
------

As we saw in the last exercise, any time you snap to a line or object in
FormIt, a join occurs. To avoid this, you can Group an object(s.) But
this is not all, copies of Groups maintain their connection to the
original. Editing any copy of a Group edits all of them. This is similar
to Components in SketchUp and Family instances in Revit.
