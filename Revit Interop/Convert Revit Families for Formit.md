### Convert Revit Families for use in FormIt
---

1. Open Revit 2016 or 2017 and start a blank file from the Architectural Template. 

2. From the Add-Ins tab select **Convert RFA to FormIt 360** from the FormIt 360 Converter.

3. Set the first path to **FormIt Primer\\content\\RFA** and the Converted Files path to **FormIt Primer\\content** and press OK.![](./images/032cef9c-00dd-4e03-9b89-01d93ff6e1ac.png)

4. This process will take a number of minutes as Revit opens each RFA in the first path and converts it to a format that FormIt 360 can read.

**Note**: *You do not need to run this process during the tutorial, since all of the conversions have been made already. That is where the Corbu Chair and other content in the previous exercise came from.*
