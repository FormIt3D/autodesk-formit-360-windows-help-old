# 1.14 - Export Image

_In this chapter, we will be exporting a high-resolution image of the sectional perspective scene we have built up over the last few chapters._

_Although not required to complete this chapter, if you did not follow the whole tutorial up until this point and would like to export images similar to what is shown below, download and open the_ _**1.14 – Export Image.axm**_ _file from the_ _**FormIt Primer Part 1 Datasets**._

1 - When exporting an image, whatever is shown in the canvas will be exported almost exactly as you see it in FormIt. We would like to export an image of the **Section** Scene.

1. So first we need to open up that scene form the **Scenes Palette** by double-click on it.
2. From the **Main Manu** bar, go to **File &gt; Export &gt; Locally \(Ctrl + E\)**. The **Export File** window will pop-up.
3. In the new window, under **File type options** scroll down and select **As Image** \(it is the last one\). In the export options box, after **Preset:** changes the dropdown option to be **4K UHD** instead of **Viewport**. This will automatically define the output image resolution, **Dimension \(px\)**, to **3840** x **2160** pixels.
4. Click on **Export** and the **Specify file to save to…** window will pop-up.
5. In the new window, navigate to choose the location and name to save the image at, then click **Save**.
