# 1.12 - Visual Styles

_Modeling conceptual masses is just half of what FormIt has to offer. The other half are beautiful graphics that help to tell a story to a client, or team member. In this chapter, we will cover ways to set up your_ _**graphic visual styles**_ _and create animations._

_If you did not complete the last section, download and open the_ _**1.12 – Visual Styles.axm**_ _file from the_ _**FormIt Primer Part 1 Datasets**._

## **Create an Animation**

_In these next steps, we will learn how to use_ _**Scenes**_ _to create an animation._

1 – To create the first **Scene**:

1. Turn on all the layers except **Terrain**, **Plan Image,** and **Massing**.
2. Make sure the camera mode is set to **Perspective \(VP\)**, and position the camera so that it is looking at the entire house from slightly above, similar to the image below.
3. Open the **Scenes Palette**.
4. Click on the **+** icon to create a new scene from our current view.
5. Rename it to **Aerial View 1**, and match the other **Scene Properties** to what is shown in the image below.

2 - To create the second **Scene** and then animate between them:

1. Adjust the camera to a new position so that you are looking at the house from a different angle. Create a new **Scene** named **Aerial View 2** using the same process we followed in the previous step.
2. Click the **Play** button. After the set **Pause Time** of **2 Seconds**, the animation will start slowly moving back and forth between the two scenes. This will continue until you click the **Stop** button to stop the animation.

_**Note:**_ _You can adjust the_ _**Pause Time**,_ _**Transition Time**, and_ _**Camera Speed**_ _using the settings at the bottom of the_ _**Scene Properties**. Try adding some more scenes and playing with these settings to customize your animation._

## **Customize the Visual Styles**

_Now we are going to create another scene with some customized **Visual Styles** settings._

1 - First, open the **Visual Styles Palette**. Note there are four \(4\) tabs at the top, each containing different visual settings: **Surfaces**, **Edges**, **Environment**, and **Model Diagnostics**. To learn more about each tab visit the **Visual Styles** chapter in the **Tool Library** section.

2 – To customize some settings in the **Surface Tab**:

1. Turn on **Shadows \(DS\)**.
2. Turn on **Ambient Shadows \(DA\)**.
3. Turn on **Monotone Surfaces \(DM\)**. This makes an abstract black and white image without any materials.

3 – To customize some settings in the **Edge Tab**:

* 1. Adjust the sliders to lighten the **Edges** contrast to around **30%**.
  2. Turn on the **Extend Edges \(DX\).**
  3. Adjust the sliders to lighten the **Silhouettes** contrast to **30%**.

4 - To customize some settings in the **Environment Tab**:

1. Turn off **Axes**.
2. Turn off **Levels**, if on.

5 - Create a new scene called **Customized Scene** to save these settings. Now you can switch back and forth between the **Scenes** to reset the graphic settings.

_**Note**: If you uncheck the_ _**Camera**_ _property of the new scene, you can use it to only toggle on the visual settings we just created without move the camera position. Give it a try by going to one of your previous Aerial scenes, and then double-clicking on the_ _**Customized Scene**_ _and watching what happens!_
