# Part II

## Advanced Tools

In **Part II** of this Primer, we are going to dive into some of the more advanced tools FormIt has to offer. We will explore how to use simple yet powerful modeling, diagnostic, analysis, and interoperability tools to modify and enhance the Encode Campus Model pictured below.

If you are new to FormIt, we recommend starting with **Part I**, as **Part II** will assume you are already familiar with the basics of FormIt.

Refer to the **FormIt Introduction** and **Tool Library** sections for detailed explanations on specific tools, toolbars, palettes, and processes discussed herein.

### Pre-requisites

Before beginning Part II, download and install FormIt for Windows using the directions found in the FormIt Introduction section here: [**Prerequisites and Installation**](../../formit-introduction/prerequisites-and-installation.md).

For most chapters, you will also need to download and make use of the data set found at the link below.

_If you cannot run FormIt for Windows, the majority of the tutorial can be completed using the free_ [_**Web Application**_](https://formit.autodesk.com/app)_**.** For more information about FormIt versions and licensing, visit the_ **\*\*\[\_**FormIt website._\*]\(_[https://formit.autodesk.com](https://formit.autodesk.com)_)\\_\*\*\*\_

### Data Set

The Encode Campus, pictured above, is a fictional medium-sized multi-use project set in an urban plot, complete with organized layers, scenes, materials, and even geometries tied to live editable Dynamo scripts.

All facade elements of the Encode building are controlled by Dynamo scripts, driven by a path at the base of the building that defines the facade shape.
