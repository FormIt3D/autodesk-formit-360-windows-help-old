# Part I: Build your first FormIt Plug-in

If you are a developer and want to go the extra mile this section will guide you into developing plugins.

If you're building your first FormIt plugin, the Plugin Playground is a great place to start. Write, test, debug, and view your plugin directly inside FormIt for Web or Windows, then publish instantly to GitHub for others to try.
