# Your first plugin from the Plugin Playground

If you're building your first FormIt plugin, the Plugin Playground is a great place to start. Write, test, debug, and view your plugin directly inside FormIt for Web or Windows, then publish instantly to GitHub for others to try.

he FormIt Plugin Playground is a plugin that helps you build plugins. It creates the minimal set of files needed - and lets you modify, test, and play - never requiring you to leave the application.
