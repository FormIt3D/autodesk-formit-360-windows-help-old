# Load panel-based and toolbar-based plugin





You can load or install any of the plugins, but for the purposes of this exercise, you'll install both a panel-based and toolbar-based plugin. We'll assume your npm http-server is running on port 8080 hosting both example repositories.

#### **Load vs. Install:**

* FormIt.LoadPlugin(); loads the plugin only for that session. It will be unloaded automatically when the app is closed and restarted.
*
  * Great for temporarily manifesting a plugin for testing, for this session only.
* FormIt.InstallPlugin(); makes the plugin persist between sessions using a registry key.
*
  * Use FormIt.UninstallPlugin(); to uninstall.
  * Great for plugins you'll use frequently between sessions.
  * On Windows, the following registry keys are used to persist plugins:
  *
    * Plugins: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Autodesk\FormIt 360\Plugins\InstalledPlugins
* In the following examples, unless otherwise noted, feel free to use _Install_ and _Load_ interchangeably depending on whether you want the results of the exercise to be persistent or not.

#### **Toolbar Plugin Sample**

* In the Script Editor, run the following:
*
  * If running a local server:
  *
    * FormIt.LoadPlugin("http://localhost:8080/FlipAlong");
  * If loading from the [FormIt Github repo](https://github.com/FormIt3D/) (requires an internet connection):
  *
    * FormIt.LoadPlugin("https://formit3d.github.io/FlipAlong");
* You should see the Flip Along toolbar appear at the top of the application window:

#### **HTML Panel Plugin Sample**

* In the Script Editor, run the following:
*
  * If running a local server:
  *
    * FormIt.LoadPlugin("http://localhost:8080/PropertiesPlus");
  * If loading from the [FormIt Github repo](https://github.com/FormIt3D/) (requires an internet connection):
  *
    * FormIt.LoadPlugin("https://formit3d.github.io/PropertiesPlus");
* You should see the Properties Plus panel appear on the right side of the application window:

#### **Modal + Modeless Dialog Plugin Sample**

Dialog plugins are unique: they can only be loaded, not installed.

* In the Script Editor, run the following:
*
  * If running a local server:
  *
    * Modal: FormIt.LoadPlugin("http://localhost:8080/FormItExamplePlugins/ModalDialog");
    * Modeless: FormIt.LoadPlugin("http://localhost:8080/FormItExamplePlugins/ModelessDialog");
  * If loading from the [FormIt Github repo](https://github.com/FormIt3D/) (requires an internet connection):
  *
    * Modal: FormIt.LoadPlugin("https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/ModalDialog");
    * Modal: FormIt.LoadPlugin("https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/ModelessDialog");
* You should see the Hello Block! panel from the HTML Panel example appear on screen as either a modal or modeless dialog.
