# Plugin Playground

## What is the Plugin Playground?

The Plugin Playground is an out-of-the-box feature that lets you quickly develop and test plugins in FormIt. It's a great concept-modeling environment where you can make your 3D ideas reality in no time. You don't need any additional software, so there's no need to leave the FormIt app. It comes with a sample plugin, so you don't need to set up your plugin from scratch. Simply test your code and save your project to your GitHub account, all in the Playground panel.&#x20;

Here are some of the benefits of developing in the Plugin Playground:

* No additional installation required
* Develop, test, and run plugins within the FormIt desktop or web app
* Fast and easy file setup with sample code included
* Save your project to your own GitHub account
* Use the recording feature

## Installing the Plugin Playground

You can think of the Plugin Playground as a plugin that makes plugins. This is because you install it as you would install any other plugin. Open the Plugin Manager, and you will find the Plugin Playground under the Recommended list. Use the toggle to install the Plugin Playground.
