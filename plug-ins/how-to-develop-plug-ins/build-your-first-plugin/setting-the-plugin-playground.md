# Plugin Playground

## What is the Plugin Playground?

The plugin playground is an out-of-the-box feature that lets you quickly develop and test plugins in FormIt. It is a great concept-modeling environment where you can get your 3D ideas into reality in no time. You do not need any additional software, so there is no need to leave the FormIt app. It comes with a sample plugin so you do not need to set up your plugin from scratch. Simply test your code and save your project to your Github account all via the playground window.&#x20;

Here are some of the benefits of developing via the plugin playground:

* No additional installation required
* Develop, test & run plugins within FormIt desktop/web app
* Fast and easy setup files with sample code included
* Save your project to your own Github account
* Use the recording feature

## Installing the Plugin Playground

You can think of the plugin playground as a plugin that makes plugins. This is because you install it as you would install any other plugin. Open your plugin manager, you will find the plugin playground under the recommended list. Toggle the button to install/enable the plugin playground.

You can access it through the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>) icon.
