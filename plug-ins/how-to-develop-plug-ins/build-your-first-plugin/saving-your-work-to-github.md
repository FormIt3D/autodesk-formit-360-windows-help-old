# Saving Your Work to GitHub

As you work on your plugin, you’ll want to save your progress. To make this possible, we have integrated GitHub directly into the Plugin Playground.

### Adding a New Plugin Project to Your GitHub Account

Click the button to log in to GitHub and allow FormIt to access to your repositories (projects).

In a few moments, the newly created project will appear in your projects list. Select the project from the drop-down to load it.
