# Saving Your Work to GitHub

As you work on your plugin, youâ€™ll want to save your progress. To make this possible, we have integrated GitHub directly into the Plugin Playground.

### Adding a New Plugin Project to Your GitHub Account

Click the button to log in to GitHub and allow FormIt to access to your repositories (projects).
