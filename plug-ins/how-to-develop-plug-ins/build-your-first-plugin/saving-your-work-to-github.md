# Saving Your Work to GitHub

As you work on your plugin, youâ€™ll want to save your progress. To make this possible we have integrated GitHub directly into the Plugin Playground.

### Adding a New Plugin Project to Your GitHub Account

Simply click the button to login to GitHub and allow FormIt3D to have access to your repositories (projects).

In a few moments the newly created project will show in your projects list. Select the project from the drop-down to load it.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, your new project comes with a sample plugin that creates a cube.
