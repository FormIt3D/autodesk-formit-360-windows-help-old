# Publishing a plugin

If you created the plugin with the [Plugin Playground](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/HowToBuild.html#PluginPlayground), you can publish your plugin with the bullhorn icon.

If you created the plugin without the [Plugin Playground](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/HowToBuild.html#PluginPlayground), you can publish your plugin by:

*   Adding a **formit-plugin** topic to your plugin's repository

    ![plugin topic](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/images/topic.png)
*   Enabling GitHub pages on your project. This can be found and set in the Setting tabs of your repository.

    Under the **GitHub Pages** section, choose the branch you want to use. Typically choose **master** or **main**.

    ![install pages](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/images/pages.png)

If you'd like your plugin to appear under the list of recommended plugins in the Plugin Manager, add an additional topic to your repository, **formit-plugin-recommended**. The FormIt team will then review your plugin.
