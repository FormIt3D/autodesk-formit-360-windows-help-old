# Previewing a Plugin in the Plugin Manager

### Install/preview Locally Hosted Plugin from Plugin Manager

To preview how the plugin would appear in the Plugin Manager (updated title, description, etc) before it's pushed to GitHub, you can paste the localhost URL into the box at the bottom of the Plugin Manager:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

Then look for your plugin in the Installed section at the top:
