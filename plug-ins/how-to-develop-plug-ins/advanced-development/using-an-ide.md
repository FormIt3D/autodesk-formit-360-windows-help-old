# Using an IDE

Developing plugins with the [Plugin Playground](../build-your-first-plugin/setting-the-plugin-playground.md) is simple and convenient. However, you may want to develop plugins using an external integrated development environment (IDE). Some of the benefits of using an IDE include:&#x20;

* You can use your preferred IDE, which may provide syntax error correction, extensions, etc.
* You can collaborate with colleagues to develop a FormIt plugin via a GitHub repository.
* You can develop private plugins and host them on a local server.

### Install an IDE

A free IDE that works well for FormIt plugin development is Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Follow the link to download the setup file and complete the installation.

We will be using Visual Studio Code for this demonstration, but you may use your preferred code editor. Make sure your IDE includes a terminal for running your local server.
