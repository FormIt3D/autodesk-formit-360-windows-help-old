# Hosting a Plugin on GitHub

Built a useful plugin that you want to share? Host your repository on GitHub so others can install your plugins from the [Plugin Manager](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/index.html)!

### Host your plugin project

The process is similar to and earlier chapter where we discuss how to [publish your plugin](../build-your-first-plugin/publish-your-project.md) create from the Plugin Playground. &#x20;

Go to your new GitHub plugins repo, i.e. https://github.com/Joe/JoesPlugins

In the top-right corner, click the Settings tab.

Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, enable GitHub Pages, and use the _main _branch.

### Continue to Update your Plugin Project Locally

At this point, you can continue adding, modifying, and testing plugins locally, and when you're ready to publish, use GitHub Desktop or another Git client to push your changes to your GitHub repo. Anyone consuming your repo and plugins will always get the latest code when they start FormIt.



### Publish your Project

For projects created in an IDE instead of [Plugin Playground](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/HowToBuild.html#PluginPlayground), you can publish your plugin by adding a **FormIt-plugin** topic to your plugin's repository.

This allows your plugin to be discovered in the [community plugins](../../example-1/formit-plugin-community.md) list.

View your repo on Github by visiting your project link, e.g: https://github.com/Joe/JoesPlugin

Click on settings

Add your plugin description, add formit-plugin to your topic field then save changes

Once saved, your plugin project will be added to [community plugins](https://github.com/topics/formit-plugin) list.
