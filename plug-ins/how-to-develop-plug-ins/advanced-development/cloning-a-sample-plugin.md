# Cloning a Sample Plugin

### Clone an existing FormIt plugin repo

You can clone various first-party FormIt plugin repos, which demonstrate different UI types and some advanced functionality that can be achieved with plugins.

Each first-party plugin is now stored in its own repo. You'll find them all here: [FormIt3D Organization Repos](https://github.com/FormIt3D)

### GitHub Desktop

You can also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), which provides an easy-to-use interface for cloning repos, seeing changes to files, and pushing/pulling changes between your local computer and online repos. Some of the features GitHub desktop provides are:

* Create a new repo to host your plugin on GitHub.
* Use GitHub Desktop to clone your new (empty) GitHub repository to your local machine.
* Develop your plugin by adding new files to the repo folder locally.
* Use GitHub Desktop to push your plugin files and directories to your repository.
* Enable GitHub Pages in your repository so FormIt can load and display your GitHub-hosted plugins.
