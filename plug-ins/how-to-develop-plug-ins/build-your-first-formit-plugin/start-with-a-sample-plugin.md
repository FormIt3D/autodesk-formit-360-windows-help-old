# Start with a sample plugin



You can clone various first-party FormIt plugin repos, which demonstrate different UI types and some advanced functionality that can be achieved with plugins.

1. Each first-party plugin is now stored in its own repo. You'll find them all here: [FormIt3D Organization Repos](https://github.com/FormIt3D)
2. You can also download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), which provides an easy-to-use interface for cloning repos, seeing changes to files, and pushing/pulling changes between your local computer and online repos.



### Open your project in Visual Studio Code

Use File > Open Folder to select the folder that contains your plugin files and folders
