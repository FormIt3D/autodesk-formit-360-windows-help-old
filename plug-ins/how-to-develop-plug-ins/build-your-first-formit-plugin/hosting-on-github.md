# Hosting on GitHub

Built a useful plugin that you want to share? Host your repository on GitHub so others can install your plugins from the [Plugin Manager](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/index.html)!

### Host your plugin project

The process is similar to and earlier chapter where we discuss how to host your plugin create from the Plugin Playground. &#x20;

Go to your new GitHub plugins repo, i.e. https://github.com/Joe/JoesPlugins

In the top-right corner, click the Settings tab.

Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, enable GitHub Pages, and use the _master_ branch.

At this point, you can continue adding, modifying, and testing plugins locally, and when you're ready to publish, use GitHub Desktop or another Git client to push your changes to your GitHub repo. Anyone consuming your repo and plugins will always get the latest code when they start FormIt.



For project created in an IDE instead of [Plugin Playground](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/HowToBuild.html#PluginPlayground), you can publish your plugin by:

*   Adding a **formit-plugin** topic to your plugin's repository

    ![plugin topic](https://formit3d.github.io/FormItExamplePlugins/docs/images/topic.png)
*   Enabling GitHub pages on your project. This can be found and set in the Setting tabs of your repository.

    Under the **GitHub Pages** section, choose the branch you want to use. Typically choose **master** or **main**.
