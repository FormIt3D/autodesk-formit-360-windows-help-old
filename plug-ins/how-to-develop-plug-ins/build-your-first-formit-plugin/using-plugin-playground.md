# Using Plugin Playground

You don't need to install any additional software to start develop your own plugin. Plugin Playground is developed to simplify the process of developing and testing plugin without having to leave the FormIt app. It comes with a set of sample code so you do not have to set it up from scratch. Simple test your code, save your project to your Github by logging in to your account via the playground window. 

To use it, you simply have to enable the plugin playround from the [plugin manager](../../how-to-use-plug-ins/the-plugin-manager.md).
