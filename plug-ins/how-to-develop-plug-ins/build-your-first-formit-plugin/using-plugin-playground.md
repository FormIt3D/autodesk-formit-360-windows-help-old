# Using Plugin Playground

You do not have to install any additional software to start develop your own plugin. Plugin Playground is developed to simplify the process of developing and testing plugin without having to leave the FormIt app. It comes with a set of sample code so you do not have to set it up from scratch. Simply test your code, save your project to your Github by logging in to your account via the playground window. 

Here are some of the benefits of developing via Plugin playground:

* No additional installation require
* Develop, test & run plugins within FormIt desktop/web app
* Fast and easy setup files with sample code included
* Save your project to your own Github account

To use it, follow the next chapter to enable it from the [plugin manager](../../how-to-use-plug-ins/the-plugin-manager.md).
