# Build your first FormIt Plugin

If you are a developer and want to go the extra mile this section will guide you into developing plugins.

If you're building your first FormIt plugin, the Plugin Playground is a great place to start. Write, test, debug, and view your plugin directly inside FormIt for Web or Windows, then publish instantly to GitHub for others to try.

If you would like to develop FormIt plugin in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) e.g Visual Studio Code, please refer:
