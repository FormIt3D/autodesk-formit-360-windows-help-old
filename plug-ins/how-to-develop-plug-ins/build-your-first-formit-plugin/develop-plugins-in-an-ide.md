# Develop plugins in an IDE

It is very simple and convenient to develop plugin inside [plugin playground](using-plugin-playground.md). However, for any reason, such as ones listed below:&#x20;

* Collaborate with your colleagues on developing FormIt plugin
* Develop within your chosen Intergrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Develop a private plugin and hosting from local server
* Want to understand how to develop plugin outside of Plugin Playground

This guide demonstrates how to do so and the concept is quite similar to developing using the plugin playground.



### Install an IDE

You may use any of your prefered code editor, we will be using Visual Studio Code for this demonstration. Write your code in an IDE that helps identify issues, correct syntax errors, and includes a terminal for running your local server.

A free IDE that works well for FormIt plugin development is Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Follow the link to download setup file and complete the installation.
