# Develop plug-ins in an IDE

It is super easy and convenient to develop plugin inside plugin playground, we have also covered the pros and cons earlier in the guide, if you prefer to develop in an IDE, the concept is quite similar to developing using the playground. This guide will show you how to do that in an IDE (you may use any of your prefered IDE, we will be using Visual studio code for this demonstration)

#### Install an IDE

Write your code in an integrated development environment (IDE) that helps identify issues, correct syntax errors, and includes a terminal for running your local server.

A free IDE that works well for FormIt plugin development is Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Once installed:

* File > Open Folder
* Select the folder that contains your plugin files and folders.
