# How to Develop Plugins

For the tinkerers and developers out there, FormIt also ships with a plugin that allows you to create and test your own custom plugins right inside of FormIt. Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required to take full advantage of this tool so we will not go into detail here. 

This section will cover:
