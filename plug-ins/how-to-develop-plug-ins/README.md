# How to Develop Plugins

For the tinkerers and developers out there, FormIt is a great tool to develop Plugins. There are two modes of development you can choose from depending on your development skills and the complexity of the project you wish to execute.&#x20;

* We recommend that you start with the [Build Your First Plugin](build-your-first-plugin/) section. That guides you to creating a simple plugin using the plugin playground.&#x20;
* If you want to develop a more complex project we recommend following the [Advanced: Using Your Own IDE](advanced-using-your-own-ide/) section.
* You can also check the [Tips and Tricks](tips-and-tricks/) section for some suggestions on improving your developer experience.&#x20;
