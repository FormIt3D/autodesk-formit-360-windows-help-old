# My First Plugin

### Save your work

As you work on your plugin, you’ll want to save your progress. We have made an integration with GitHub to make this achievable.

1. Login to GitHub and allow FormIt3D to have access to your repositories (projects).
2. Create a project. Type in a name and click the + button.

3\. In a few moments the newly created project will show in your projects list. Select it to load it. This will load the same default plugin from above, because this is the defualt state of a plugin.

4\. You can work as before, and use the Save button to save your progress.

5\. You can also find and edit your files in GitHub interface or another editor of your choice. To access the files in GitHub, use the GitHub button.
