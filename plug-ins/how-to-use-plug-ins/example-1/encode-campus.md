# Installing Plugins

FormIt comes with several plugins that expand its built-in capabilities. You can also install plugins developed by the AEC community, or even build your own.

_In this chapter, we are going to sample a few of the plugins that come with FormIt to make some improvements to the_ _**Encode Campus Sample Model.axm**. If you have not already, you can download the file from the_ _**FormIt Primer Part 2 Dataset**.._

1.  to the **Plugin Manager Palette** at any time and toggle the plugins sliders on or off, which will add or remove the plugins and their icons from your FormIt session.
2. If you have too many installed plugins icons to fit on your screen, you can hide some unused ones by toggling their visibility in the **Window** dropdown from the main **Menu Bar**.
