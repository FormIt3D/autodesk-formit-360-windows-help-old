# Using Plugins

Each plugin will have a unique UI defined by its developer. A plugin will usually have a set of instructions on how to run it, a set of parameters (text boxes, sliders, checkboxes, etc.), and one or more buttons to execute it.

To use one of the simpler examples on the Plugin Manager we will use the 'Fillet 2D Corners'. We first load the plugin from the recommended section of the Plugin Manager. Then following the instructions provided by the developer, we must set the fillet radius, then select a group of faces to fillet, and finally, click on the 'Fillet Corners' button.
