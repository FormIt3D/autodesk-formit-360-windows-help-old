# Introduction to Plugins

## What Are Plugins?

 Plug-ins are additions that expand FormIt's core functionality. Created to help enhance/empower/simplify the modeling process, productivity, or workflow when 3d modeling in FormIt. Plug-ins can be used for generating objects, making modifications or extracting info & properties of an object. Features of plug-ins may be as simple as fillet 2 edges, or as advance as generating a string of light fixtures. You may find plug-ins developed by the communities or Autodesk from GitHub. You may even create your own plug-ins to suit the needs of different project.
