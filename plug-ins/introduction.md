Plugins are custom software additions that expand FormIt's core functionality. Plugins can enhance, empower, and simplify your 3D modeling workflows in FormIt.&#x20;

Plugins can be used to generate objects, make modifications to existing objects, or extract information about an object. Plugins can also use rich web interfaces to display data and provide controls and inputs directly in the application.&#x20;
