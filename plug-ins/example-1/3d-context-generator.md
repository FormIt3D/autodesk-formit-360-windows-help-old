## What is it?

3D Context Generator is a very easy-to-use plugin that will help you quickly generate 3d context inside FormIt. This plugin can help you:

* Visualize your project site with its surrounding context
* Make informed decisions especially in the early stage of the design process.
* Is free for all users of FormIt to download.&#x20;

This plugin retrieves data from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) to help transform it into FormIt geometries. The source code for this plugin is available on Github.&#x20;
