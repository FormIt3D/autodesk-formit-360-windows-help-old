# What Are Plugins?

Plugins are additions that expand FormIt's core functionality. Plugins can enhance, empower, and simplify your 3D modeling workflow in FormIt.&#x20;

Plugins can be used to generate objects, make modifications, or extract information about an object. Plugins may be as simple as filleting 2D edges, or as advanced as generating a string of light fixtures.&#x20;

You can find plugins developed by the FormIt community or by Autodesk on GitHub. You can also create your own plugins to fit the needs of various projects.
