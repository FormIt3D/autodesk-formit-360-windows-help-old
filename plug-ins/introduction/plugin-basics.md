# Plugin Basics

Plugins are custom software additions that expand FormIt's core functionality. Plugins can enhance, empower, and simplify your 3D modeling workflows in FormIt.&#x20;

Plugins can be used to generate objects, make modifications to existing objects, or extract information about an object. Plugins can also use rich web interfaces to display data and provide controls and inputs directly in the application.&#x20;

FormIt features a Plugin Manager which provides access to plugins [created by the FormIt team](https://github.com/FormIt3D), as well as those created by the community. The next sections will explore the Plugin Manager and more about the plugin infrastructure, or you can jump directly to the [development section if you're ready to build your ow](../how-to-develop-plug-ins/)n.
