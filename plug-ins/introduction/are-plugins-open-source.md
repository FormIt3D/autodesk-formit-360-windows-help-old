# Are Plugins Open Source?



![](../../.gitbook/assets/c18.PNG)

Plugins are open source, this means that you may use plugins in the [installed plugins](../how-to-use-plug-ins/the-plugin-manager.md#installed-plugins) section and the [recommended plugins](../how-to-use-plug-ins/the-plugin-manager.md#recommended-plugins) section free of charge.&#x20;

If you are a developer and want more information on how to publish your plugins you can do it through the following section: [Publish your project and hosting on GitHub](../how-to-develop-plug-ins/advanced-using-your-own-ide/deployment/hosting-on-github.md)&#x20;

If you want to make a plugin for private use you can always develop and host using a local service. For more information refer to the following section: [Develop plugins in an IDE ](../how-to-develop-plug-ins/advanced-using-your-own-ide/set-up-and-cloning/develop-plugins-in-an-ide.md)
