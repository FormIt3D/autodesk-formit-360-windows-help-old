# Are Plugins Open Source?



Plugins are open source, which means that you can use the plugins in the [Plugin Manager](../how-to-use-plug-ins/the-plugin-manager.md) free of charge.&#x20;

If you are a developer and want more information on how to publish your plugins, see [Hosting a Plugin on GitHub](../how-to-develop-plug-ins/advanced-development/hosting-a-plugin-on-github.md).&#x20;

If you want to make a plugin for private use, you can develop and host it using a local service. For more information, see [Using an IDE. ](../how-to-develop-plug-ins/advanced-development/using-an-ide.md)
