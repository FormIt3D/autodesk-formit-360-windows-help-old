# What Are Plugins?

Plugins are additions that expand FormIt's core functionality. Created to help enhance/empower/simplify the modeling process, productivity, or workflow when 3d modeling in FormIt. 

Plugins can be used for generating objects, making modifications, or extracting information & properties of an object. Features of plugins may be as simple as creating fillet 2 edges, or as advance as generating a string of light fixtures. 

You may find plugins developed by the communities or Autodesk from GitHub. You may even create your own plugins to suit the needs of different projects.
