### Create unique Groups
---

1. Repeat Step 7 above with the two columns on the southwest side of the building.

2. Copy them to the south side of the lower terrace.

3. Right click both copied groups and select Make Unique (M U) - now both copied columns belong to a new group.

4. Edit one of the new groups and name it **Column short**.

5. Edit the group and shorten the new columns to the same height as the lower terrace. They should be **3’2”**.

6. Using the plan image as a guide, copy Column short two more times to get to this result:![](./images/9ffda7dc-4259-4e4b-8b72-37009701f81a.png)
