> There are some nice ways to look at and study your FormIt model. There is a suite of visual style settings that can be applied quickly to give your model some pizzazz. FormIt allows you to control how elements are viewed within the sketch by adjusting shadows, surfaces, edges, and the environment. In addition to a pre-populated list of materials, you can make your own materials out of images and color that can be quickly applied to give your model some life. Layers can be used to control the visibility of lines, objects, groups, or images.
