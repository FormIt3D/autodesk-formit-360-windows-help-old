### Create Unique Groups
---

1. Repeat Step 7 above with the two columns on the southwest side of the building.

2. Copy them to the south side of the lower terrace.

3. **Right-click** both copied groups and select **Make Unique (M U)** - now both copied columns belong to a new group.

4. Edit one of the new groups and name it **Column short**.

5. Edit the group and shorten the new columns to the same height as the lower terrace. They should be **3’-2”**.

6. Using the plan image as a guide, copy Column short two more times to get to this result:![](./images/9ffda7dc-4259-4e4b-8b72-37009701f81a.png)
