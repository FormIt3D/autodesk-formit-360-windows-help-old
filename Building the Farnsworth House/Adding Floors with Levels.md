###Levels
---
>Levels allow you to slice masses into individual floors and calculate
gross area for the entire project - or by building. Levels will
translate to Revit when the file is converted.

---

#### Create, Edit, and Apply Levels
1. You can create new levels using the [**Level Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) in the **Palette Bar**.

2. Click **+** (**Add Level**) four times to add a single Level at **0’-0", 2'-2" , 4’-6" **and** 15’-8"** (you can also click the **++** icon to create multiple levels – handy for tall buildings).

3. **Edit the Level name** by clicking on the name. Name them **Level 1, Terrace, Floor 1, **and** Top of Cornice** – these level names will now translate into Revit.

4. Select the **main massing** and in the [**Properties Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md), click **Apply Levels** and only check Main Floor. The Properties Palette now reads the area of this mass.
