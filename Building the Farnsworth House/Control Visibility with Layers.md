### Layers
---

>Much like AutoCAD and Photoshop, Layers in FormIt allow you to manage the visibility of objects in your scene. We are going to create a layer to save and hide the building mass for later analysis.

1. Click the [**Layers Palette**](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md) and click the **+** sign twice to create three layers.

2. Double click the layers to rename them: **massing, Floor 1, plan image**. <br>

3. Select the **massing Group** and choose the **massing layer** from the "Selection On" menu in the Layers Palette.

4. Create a copy of the Group by pressing **Ctrl+C** and then **Ctrl+V**.

5. Right click on the copied Group and choose **Make Unique (MU)**. The Group is now its own unique Group and will not update with the other one. ![](./images/3f46a20c-a1ab-44a1-8ba3-d2cdb050f1bd.png)

6. Select the **newly created group** and choose **Floor 1** from the menu. This will be the basis for the first floor.

7. Move it to exact spot of the original Group by selecting the lower left corner. 

8. Uncheck the **massing** layer to hide it.

9. Edit the **Floor 1 Group** and select the **top face**. Move it down **11'-2"**. The resulting floor should be 1' thick.

10. Select the plan image group and create and assign it to a new **Plan Image** layer.
