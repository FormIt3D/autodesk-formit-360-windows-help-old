### Groups
---

>Any time you snap to a line or object in FormIt, a join occurs. To avoid this, you can Group an object(s). But this is not all, copies of Groups maintain their connection to the original. Editing any copy of a Group edits all of them. This is similar to Components in SketchUp and Family instances in Revit.

> If you did not complete the last section, click the Gallery button &gt; New Sketch and then Import &gt; Import 3D Model &gt; open **farnsworth02.axm** from the FormIt Primer folder.

#### Creating and Editing a Group

1. Select the **first rectangular mass** that you created.

2. **Right click** and **create a Group (G)**. ![](./images/c2f57781-ec11-4fbd-87b0-c5fd33ad8b07.png)

3. Select the Group by single-clicking. **Move** the entire Group up **4'-6"**. **Press and hold the Shift key** when the blue Z axis guide appears to lock onto that axis. ![](./images/293f6046-366c-43ca-858b-389f0c260be6.png)

4. It is important to name Groups as you will have many of them to keep track of. To name the Group, **double-click** to start the edit mode and then open the **Properties palette** to name the Group **"main building"**. ![](./images/93c9106d-7676-4cd7-b5e2-b00a56c4e30f.png)

5. Close the edit mode by clicking on the **check mark** in the upper left. ![](./images/3b0e7944-9cb1-4852-9b3b-aedf75fc5270.png)



**Note**: *Each Group has their own undo/redo "stack" that is distinct from the top level project.*
