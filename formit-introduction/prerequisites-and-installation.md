## Recommended System Configuration

| Requirement | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Microsoft® Windows® 7, 8.1, or 10  _Note: Parallels Desktop is now supported with FormIt v17.4 and newer. However, Parallels does not support all OpenGL APIs FormIt requires, so it will have degraded performance in large models compared to non-Parallels machines._ |
| **CPU** | Intel® Pentium®, Xeon®, or i-Series processor or AMD® equivalent with SSE2 technology. Highest affordable CPU speed rating recommended. |
| **Memory** | 4 GB RAM minimum, 8GB or higher recommended. |
| **Video Card \(GPU\)** | A discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU that supports OpenGL 4.2 and DirectX 11 or higher is strongly recommended. For systems with switchable graphics cards, follow manufacturer instructions to ensure FormIt always uses the dedicated GPU. See instructions for [AMD ](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/dh-017)and [NVIDIA](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2615/kw/manage%203d%20settings/related/1).   For best performance and reliability, ensure your graphics card drivers are up-to-date from the manufacturer's website or Windows Update. FormIt will show a message at startup if it's unable to use your video card due to outdated drivers or other issues. If FormIt fails to start after updating drivers, please [reach out on the forums](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/formit-forum/bd-p/142). |
| **Disk Space** | 1 GB free disk space. |
| **Connectivity and Licensing** | An Autodesk account entitled with a FormIt Pro cloud subscription is required to run FormIt Pro on Windows. FormIt Pro is available as part of the [**Autodesk AEC Collection**](https://www.autodesk.com/collections/architecture-engineering-construction/overview). |
