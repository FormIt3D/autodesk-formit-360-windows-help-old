> The goal of following exercises is to give you an understanding of the basic operations within FormIt. We will cover ** copy, array, rotate, select/move, scale, **and** cut/join.**

#### Placing Primitive Object
1. In the [Action Toolbar](/tool-library/tool-bars-extended.md) click to open **Primitives button** and [select](/tool-library/select-edge-face-or-object.md) the cube. <br>

3. Place a **Cylinder** as well.


#### Moving Objects

1. **Double Click** to select an entire object (single click will select a face, edge or vertex, which is explained in [Modifying Faces Edges and Points](../modifying-faces-edges-and-points.md).)

2. Click and move the circle to the point you will use as the **snap point.** ![](../images/snap point.png)

3. **Click and then start dragging**. You are now moving the object and the preselected point will now be your snap point. <br> ![](../images/move-object.png)

4. Press the **tab key.** You can now type in a specific distance to move that object along the current axis.

5. **Right click** on the cube. You will see the **Context Menu**. ![](../images/context-menu.png)
