#### Understanding Drawing and Modeling Axes

When a blank sketch is opened in FormIt 360, the World Axes are displayed as three red, green and blue lines in the center of the screen. These three lines, define the three Cartesian directions that define the 3D world. The "X" direction is defined by the red line, the "Y" direction by the green line and the "Z" or "up" direction by the blue line.

* The **red, green and blue axes** display to allow you to sketch in 3D without leaving the tool.

* The **purple axis** displays an axis relative to the lines you are currently drawing.

* Hold down the **Shift key** while dragging a line segment to **lock to the current axis**.
