# Orthographic Camera

FormIt 2021 includes the addition of a new Orthographic Camera feature. You can find the Orthographic and Perspective buttons in the Navigation Menu:

![Orthographic \(bottom\) and Perspective \(top\) camera view buttons ](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-07-at-2.12.52-pm.png)

This new option allows you to easily toggle between the Orthographic and Perspective camera views.

Once in Orthographic camera, any other camera tools will respect the current mode. For example, **Align Camera to Face** will align the Orthographic Camera to the face, resulting in an orthographic elevation view.

If you navigate manually to a pre-set Orthographic View, like Top View, or Front View, the Orthographic Camera will snap to that position, making it easier to access those pre-set views.

**Note:** If camera clipping occurs in Orthographic Camera mode, you can switch back to Perspective Mode, zoom out, and then try again.
