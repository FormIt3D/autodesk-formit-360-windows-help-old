# Faces: Extrude, Cut and Offset

Push or pull a face, imprint new shapes on existing ones, or create new offset edges.

## Extrude

To push or pull a face, select a face with a single click, then click and drag. The face will move back and forth, you can now move your mouse to snap and inference on other model elements. Click again to finish moving the face. Hold down the CTRL key to retain the original edges.

## Imprint

To imprint shapes, use a 3D Sketch tool to draw lines, arcs, splines, rectangles, or circles onto existing faces. This action creates new faces that can be pushed or pulled independently of the original face.
