# Selection

## Direct Selection

To **select a vertex, edge, or face**, hover over the object, then single-click to select it.

To **select an entire object**, or an object and anything attached to it, double click the object.

You can also hold Ctrl or Shift, and add or remove elements from the current selection.

## Selection Filtering

For area or lasso selection \(see below\), you can filter the selection based on type.

This is especially useful when you've got a mix of geometry types in close proximity, and you want to use area or lasso selection to cast a wide net, but retrieve only a certain type of geometry, while excluding others.

## Area/Window Selection

To **select multiple pieces of geometry simultaneously**, use the window selection tool. Make sure you have nothing selected, then click and drag your mouse from left to right, or from right to left, to capture multiple pieces.

## Lasso Selection

For **more precise control** when selecting multiple pieces of geometry simultaneously, use the lasso tool. You can select it from the context menu after right-clicking over the empty canvas. Then draw a boundary around your desired selection area.
