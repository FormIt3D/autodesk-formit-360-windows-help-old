# Copy Object

There are three ways to copy an object.

**Copy Using the Context Menu**

1. Select the object by double-clicking it.
2. Right-click the object.
3. Select the [**Copy tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md) in the Context Menu.
4. Right-click anywhere else in the scene and choose the **Paste button**.

Note: This also works with **CTRL + C** or **V**. Use Paste In Place \(**CTRL+Shift+V**\) to paste an object exactly where it was copied from.

**Copy Using the CTRL Key**

1. Select the object by clicking it \(double-click to select a whole body or everything attached\).
2. Press and hold the **CTRL key** and start dragging the object, or start moving the object and then tap **CTRL**
3. Instead of moving the object, you'll now be moving a copy of it.
4. Note that Ctrl-copy does not currently work when Touch Mode is enabled. 

**Copy Using the Array Tool**

1. Select the object by double-clicking it
2. **Right-click** the object and select the [**Array tool**](tilt-array-copy-and-paste.md)
3. Select the number of copies you want to make
4. Choose whether the next drag will define the distance between two objects or the total length of the array.
5. Click **OK .**  ![](../.gitbook/assets/array_properties.png)
