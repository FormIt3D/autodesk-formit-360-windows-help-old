### Modifying Faces, Edges and Points
---

> Things get really interesting when you start to push and pull the
objects you have placed. Single click will allow you to select a single
face, edge or, different than older version of FormIt, a corner or
point. 

---

#### Modifying Faces

1. [**Single click one**](../tool-library/select-edge-face-or-object.md) of the faces of the objects.

2. You can immediately drag that face to **push** or **pull** it. There is no need to invoke a separate tool. You can use the **snapping** to snap this face aligned with other objects in the scene.

3. As with move, you can click the **temporary dimension** or use **Tab
key** to define the amount of move.

4. You can also delete a face by using **Delete key**: **Right click &gt; X button**.

#### Modifying Edges

1. Single click one of the edges of one of the cubes.

2. You can now drag the edge along one of the axes to redefine the shape.

    - Pressing **Delete key**
    - **Right click &gt; X button**

#### Modifying Points

1. [Single click](../tool-library/select-edge-face-or-object.md) one of the corners of one of the cubes.

2. Similar to an edge, you drag the point along one of the axes to
redefine the shape. ![](./images/439874f1-e07d-4d45-9574-f52ce2761536.png)
