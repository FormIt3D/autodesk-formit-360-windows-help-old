# Modifying Faces, Edges, and Points

Things get really interesting when you start to push and pull the objects you have placed. Single click will allow you to select a single vertex, edge, face, or Mesh.

## Modifying Faces

1. Single-click a face
2. FormIt automatically puts you in the Drag Face or Extrude tool. 
3. Click somewhere to identify a starting point for the operation. 
4. After you click, you can snap to other objects to align this face.
5. As with move, you can click the **temporary dimension** or simply start typing a value to define the amount of movement.

You can also delete a face by using the **Delete** key, or by right-clicking and invoking Delete from the context menu.

You can also delete a face by using **Right click &gt; X button**.

## Modifying Edges

1. Single-click an edge
2. FormIt automatically puts you in the Move tool
3. Position your mouse over a point in space that you want to start the Move operation from.
4. Click, and now you can drag the edge to modify the shape.

## Modifying Points

1. Single-click one of the corners of one of the cubes.
2. Similar to an edge, you drag the point along one of the axes to redefine the shape. [NextNon-Uniform Scale](https://app.gitbook.com/@formit3d/s/autodesk-formit-360-windows-help/~/drafts/-MQs8s_UgCysrQBxlywu/tool-library/non-uniform-scale)
