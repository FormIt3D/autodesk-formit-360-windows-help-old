# Non-Uniform Scale

**Use Non-Uniform Scale to stretch objects in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions.**

Select any combination of Edges, Faces, Solids, Meshes, or Groups, and access Non-Uniform Scale using the keyboard shortcut **NU** or from the Context Menu option:

**Once active, you'll see a series of grips that can be used to non-uniformly scale the object in 1, 2, or 3 axes simultaneously.**

For clarity, only the grips facing the camera will be drawn. Orbit around the object if you need to adjust a grip on the other side.

Once you click a grip, you'll see a series of editable text boxes where you can adjust the scale by percentage or distance:

**Once the dimension boxes are visible, you can:**

* Start typing a number to automatically edit the percentage box and specify a scale factor.
  * Entering a negative number will reverse the direction of the scale.
* Or click to temporarily set the grip location, then click the box containing the dimension to scale by distance.
* Click off into space or hit ESC to finish the Non-Uniform Scale operation.

**Scaling at one of the corner edge grips will respect the aspect ratio of the adjacent dimensions:**

* Start typing a number to edit the percentage value.
* Or click to temporarily set the grip location, then click one of the two dimension boxes to scale by distance.
* Click off into space or hit ESC to finish the Non-Uniform Scale operation.

**Similarly, scaling at one of the corner grips will respect the aspect ratio of the entire shape, and effectively uniformly scale:**

* Start typing a number to edit the percentage value.
* Or click to temporarily set the grip location, then click one of the three dimension boxes to scale by distance.
* Click off into space or hit ESC to finish the Non-Uniform Scale operation.
