5. **Right-click** on the Blue Reflective material you just imported and choose **Paint with Material**. **Double-click the Glass Walls group** to apply the material.

**Note**: *Much like undo/redo, materials are applied and edited on a per group basis.*

1. **Copy the Floor 1 Group** to create the roof by holding the **Cntrl key** down while **dragging** the group. ![](./images/d6793055-4c50-4e96-a44e-15e5cfeeea83.png)

2. Make the copied Group unique, edit it and name it **Roof** . Import and paint the Roof with the material **Concrete &gt; White**.

3. Create the lower terrace by following the plan and using the Rectangle tool ( R ) **55' 3" long and 22'-7 3/4" wide** and extruding it **1'**. Group this and name it **Lower Terrace**.

4. Move it **2'-2"** off the ground.

5. Import and paint the Floor 1 and Lower Terrace with the material **Stone &gt; Travertine**.

6. Edit the Travertine material in both groups. Click the **Color value** and change it to **190** to lighten the effect of the material. ![](./images/7d23f82c-2f5f-4e09-b3bf-24841cccbd0a.png)
