### 3D Sketching
---
>Placing primitives is fine, but the real power of FormIt lies in the
ability to sketch in 3D. You got a sneak peak at the power of the
snapping system when you used the Rotate tool in the last exercise.
If you did not complete the last section, click the File &gt; Open and
choose **farnsworth01.axm** from the FormIt Primer folder.

#### 3D Sketching with Lines

1. We are going to first Group the image plane. This will prevent sketched lines from "sticking" to it. Select the **plane** by **double-clicking it, right-click** and **choose Group (G)**.

2. Click the **Pencil** to open the Sketching Toolbar.

3. Choose the **Line tool (L)**. ![](./images/b73dbf13-d655-42fa-ae12-164e8bda28ad.png)

4. You can immediately start to sketch using straight lines segments.
    - The **red, green and blue axes** display to allow you to sketch in 3D without leaving the tool.
    - The **purple axis** displays an axis relative to the lines you are currently drawing.
    - Hold down the **Shift key** while dragging a line segment to **lock to the current axis**.
 
5. Start with creating a rectangle on the ground plane.
    - Click **Settings &gt; turn off Snap to Grid (S G)**.
    - With the **Line tool**, click on **one corner** of the imported sketch. **Drag** along to define one edge of the upper terrace.
    - Use the **Tab key** to input exact dimensions. Make the long side **77'-4 1/8"** and the short side **28'-8**".
    - Press **Esc**. You are back in Select mode. You can now select the top face and immediately pull the volume up **12'-2"**. ![](./images/bba6b093-7e05-4a92-b792-1601dbf26ecc.png)

**Note**: *The red and green axes keep you at 90 degrees. When you draw
at an angle to the grid, a purple guide will allow you to stay 90
degrees relative to your current line.*
