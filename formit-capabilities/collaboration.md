# Collaboration

FormIt allows multiple users \(on any combination of Windows, iOS or Web clients\) to collaboratively edit a FormIt model – while seeing all of their changes in real time. Work simultaneously with others on the same sketch or share your work later.

**Note:** Collaboration is only available after you activate FormIt Pro. Clicking on the Collaboration icon will prompt you to log in with an AutoDesk 360 account entitled for FormIt Pro.
